### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Rafael

I am currently a PhD student at the School of Computing at the University of Leeds. My research focuses on robotics manipulation. In particular, I am interested in developing algorithms for non-prehensile, physics-based manipulation in clutter.

I have realeased several robotics-related open-source projects on our lab's GitHub account [here](https://github.com/roboticsleeds).
